== Additional Notes ==
* This plugin was created and has been tested in the latest php and mysql version. It's working fine using xampp 1.8.0, PHP Version 5.4.4, and PMA 3.5.2. If you find any problem please check your server version.
* This version is stable, but I'm still developing this plugin. New feature will be added in the next version.

* Since most of mobile browser doesn't support the float or CSS fixed position, the widget is disabled for mobile browser.
